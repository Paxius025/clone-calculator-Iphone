## User Interface Design
- **Layout:** Replicate the layout of the iPhone calculator, including the arrangement of buttons and the display screen.
- **Styling:** Use CSS to match the look and feel, including colors, button shapes, and typography.

## Functionality Implementation
- **Display Screen:** Implement a screen to show input numbers and results.
- **Button Functionality:** Ensure each button (numbers, operations, and special functions like clear and equals) responds correctly to user input.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Implement core arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Special Functions:** Include functionalities such as clear (C), plus/minus (Â±), percentage (%), and decimal point (.) operations.

## Event Handling
- **User Input:** Capture user input from button clicks and update the display accordingly.
- **Calculation Logic:** Process the input to perform calculations and handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).

## Testing and Debugging
- **Functionality Tests:** Test each button and operation to ensure accurate results.
- **User Experience:** Ensure the calculator responds smoothly to user interactions, without lag or errors.

By following this outline, you will create a fully functional iPhone calculator clone that replicates both the appearance and functionality of the original app.
